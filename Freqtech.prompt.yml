      This code creates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow
      and Keras. Here's a breakdown of the model architecture:


      Three convolutional layers, each followed by max pooling and dropout:


      First layer: 32 filters

      Second and third layers: 64 filters each

      All use 3x3 kernels and ReLU activation


      A flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps to a 1D vector


      A dense hidden layer with 64 units and ReLU activation, followed by
      dropout


      An output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification


      The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical
      crossentropy loss function. Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.


      To use this model:


      Prepare your dataset and preprocess the images to match the input shape
      (224, 224, 3)

      Split your data into training and validation sets

      Convert your labels to one-hot encoded format

      Use model.fit() to train the model on your data

      Evaluate the model using model.evaluate() on a test set


      Remember to adjust the input_shape and num_classes variables according to
      your specific dataset.

      Quantum Frequency Trading Platform

      Overview

      The Quantum Frequency Trading Platform is a cutting-edge, quantum-inspired
      cryptocurrency trading platform that integrates audio frequency analysis
      and liquidity pool visualization. This platform aims to provide real-time
      analytics, trading opportunities, and a unique approach to cryptocurrency
      trading.


      Features

      1. Quantum Trading Dashboard

      Real-time Analytics: The platform provides up-to-date information on the
      user's portfolio and market trends.

      Trading Opportunities: Identification of arbitrage opportunities across
      different exchanges.

      Quantum Algorithm Accuracy: The accuracy of the quantum algorithm used for
      trading decisions.

      2. Arbitrage Opportunities

      Real-time Arbitrage Detection: The platform identifies potential arbitrage
      opportunities across various cryptocurrency pairs and exchanges.

      Confidence Level: Each opportunity is assigned a confidence level to help
      users make informed decisions.

      3. Quantum Algorithm Status

      Qubits Active: Indicates the number of active qubits used in the quantum
      algorithm.

      Entanglement Rate: Measures the rate of entanglement, a key aspect of
      quantum computing.

      Circuit Depth and Shots: Parameters that define the complexity and the
      number of simulations run by the quantum algorithm.

      4. Liquidity Pool Monitor

      UniSwap Pool Integration: Monitoring of specific liquidity pools, such as
      BTC/ETH.

      Total Value Locked (TVL) and 24h Volume: Key metrics for assessing the
      liquidity and activity of the pool.

      Current APY (Annual Percentage Yield): The expected annual return on
      investment for liquidity providers.

      Technical Requirements

      To implement such a platform, several technologies and concepts are
      required:
